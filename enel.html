								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/enoc.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Enel X North America is the preferred energy solutions partner for businesses across
									North America. it connects large energy users to opportunities in the energy world and
									help them integrate the technologies and processes they need to capitalize on them.
									With 10,400 demand response sites, a total of 4.7 GW of demand response capacity and
									intelligent software in more than 50,000 electric vehicle charging stations across
									North America
								</p>
								<p>Two stints as the Systems & Analytics co-op at EnerNOC and Enel-X gave me an in depth
									insight about various processes of the Energy Markets Team. The <b>Energy Markets team</b>
									is responsible for enrollment, nomination and settlement of customers participating in
									the Demand Response program. I had the good fortune of working with geographically
									distributed teams to develop analytical tools for new and old markets

							<h2>Projects</h2>
								<h3>Utility Transform Inspector (UTI)</h3>
								<p>The UTI web application provides a simple interface to inspect and identify interval meter
									data. Leveraging <b>R-Shiny</b> and base <b>R</b> for data manipulation assisted by 
									the <b>data.table</b> package visualizations are acheived via <b>plotly</b>. Data is sourced 
									from data retrieval and transformation pipeline, since different utilities provide customer
									data in a host of different formats standardization routines try to best collate and
									normalize this data. No process is perfect hence the UTI introduces the human component
									to verify proper transformation of received data. Once a data packet has been approved
									by an Analyst the data is normalized to be stored in 
									a <b>PostGRE</b> database hosted on <b>AWS</b>
								</p>
								<h3>Nomitron</h3>
								<p>A <b>R-Shiny</b> Web application that helped program managers estimate Nomination figures (in kW)
									for customers belonging to their portfolio. Deterministic Logic was developed working with the
									<b>Program Managers</b> to capture the subtle yet distinct nuances within programs. The application
									extracted customer data and previous performance figures from <b>Salesforce</b>
									augmented by historic meter data extracted from a <b>PostGRE</b> and or <b>Oracle</b> database
								</p>
								<h3>Automated Load Notification & Baseline Calculations</h3>
								<p>Initially developed for customer's belonging to the North American market. The load notification
									system provided program managers and people responsible for certain programs a snapshot of their
									portfolio and health of datastreams in the past 24hrs.Entering the <b>Polish Demand Response</b>
									market needed a complete redesign of the existing tools. Assimilating a <b>Load Forecast Model</b>
									which generated portfolio load estimations for the selected hours of the day. Load forecasting model
									where developed based of <b>Baseline Calculation Logic</b> defined by the polish regulator. 
									Prototyping and deploying reporting formats as defined by the Polish Demand Response team
